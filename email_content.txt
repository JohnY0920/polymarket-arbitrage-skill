Subject: Canadian Tech International Expansion Success Stories - Simplified Summary

Dear John and Donald,

I hope this email finds you well.

As requested, I have completed research on Canadian tech companies that have successfully expanded their businesses internationally, with a focus on small-medium enterprises that expanded to the US and EU markets between 2023-2025.

KEY FINDINGS:
I identified 6 Canadian tech SMEs that successfully expanded internationally with impressive results:

1. UNIUNI (Logistics/Delivery) → US Market
   - Expanded to 65% of US market, covering 500+ cities
   - Achieved 2,000% revenue growth (2022-2025)
   - Secured $70M Series D funding

2. THREATIQ (Cybersecurity) → EU Market
   - Generated hundreds of EU business leads
   - Secured partnership with Spanish CyberScope
   - Successfully pivoted from US to EU focus

3. HOPPER (Travel Tech) → Global Expansion
   - $850M revenue in 2024
   - Partnerships with Air Canada, Japan SMCC, Tripadvisor
   - Total funding raised: $740M

4. NEO FINANCIAL (Fintech) → International
   - 1,279% three-year revenue growth rate
   - $360M Series D funding in 2024
   - Ranked #1 in Deloitte Technology Fast 50

SUCCESS FACTORS:
• Strong Canadian foundation before international expansion
• Strategic market selection (US vs EU with CETA benefits)
• Formation of local partnerships in target markets
• Cultural adaptation and regulatory compliance
• Focus on solving universal problems with local adaptation

The attached presentation provides a simplified summary of these success stories, including financial performance highlights and recommendations for other SMEs considering similar expansion.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if you'd like me to research specific sectors or markets in more detail.

Best regards,
