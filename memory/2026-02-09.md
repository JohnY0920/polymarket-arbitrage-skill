## Summary
Major identity system update and repository synchronization. Established JoJo as John's operational manager with comprehensive role definition. Set up hourly heartbeat for automated git management and task tracking.

## Activities

### Identity System Overhaul (Evening)
- **Updated IDENTITY.md**: Defined JoJo as operational manager
  - Executive coordination (calendar, scheduling)
  - Workflow automation (cross-tool integration)
  - Information triage (daily briefings, outreach)
  - Digital asset management (inbox, knowledge base)
  - Technical support (code, bugs, deployment, security)

- **Enhanced USER.md**: Comprehensive John profile
  - Primary role: Senior Data Scientist at BMO (Airmiles)
  - Technical skills: Databricks, Python, PySpark, SQL
  - AI consulting company with multiple business lines
  - Side projects: arbitrage trading, automation, AI agents
  - Core goals: AI and making money through automation

- **Refined SOUL.md**: Operational excellence principles
  - Be genuinely helpful, not performatively
  - Results over process, automate relentlessly
  - Money-minded, technically competent
  - Security first, transparent operations

- **Configured HEARTBEAT.md**: Hourly operations check
  - Check incomplete tasks → Telegram updates
  - Monitor git changes → auto-commit & push
  - System health checks
  - Efficient notification strategy

### Git Repository Management
- **Verified GitHub connection**: Connected to JohnY0920 (personal, not org)
- **Committed changes in 6 logical groups**:
  1. Identity files update
  2. Email system improvements (SMTP)
  3. Configuration files
  4. Daily logs and tracking data
  5. Gamma presentation updates
  6. Utility scripts
- **Security fix**: Removed real API keys from .env.example
- **Successfully pushed to remote**: All changes synchronized

### Automation Setup
- **Created hourly heartbeat cron job**
  - Runs every hour (3600000ms)
  - Executes HEARTBEAT.md tasks
  - Automated git maintenance
  - Proactive task monitoring

## Technical Notes
- Git repository: https://github.com/JohnY0920/polymarket-arbitrage-skill
- Hourly cron job ID: f82a7a96-b5b4-48e9-8b19-9b5db4c6e2f3
- Next heartbeat: ~1 hour from setup time
- All secrets protected via .gitignore
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Decisions
- Hourly (not more frequent) heartbeat to balance oversight with API costs
- Logical commit grouping for clear change history
- Secrets protection takes priority (GitHub push protection caught and fixed)
- Transparent notification strategy (only when action needed)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor hourly heartbeat execution
2. Build out automated workflows as John's business needs evolve
3. Continue daily memory file updates
4. Implement proactive task tracking and completion
