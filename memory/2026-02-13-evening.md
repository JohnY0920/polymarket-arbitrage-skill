# 2026-02-13 - Evening Summary

## Key Accomplishments Today

### 1. AI Energy Research Completed
- Successfully researched Stephen Byrd's Morgan Stanley AI energy report
- Created comprehensive summary documenting 70% annual AI energy demand growth
- Prepared presentation content ready for Gamma API automation
- Identified multi-billion dollar investment opportunities across data centers, utilities, and clean energy

### 2. System Management & Optimization
- Updated Claude API key to new provided key successfully
- Confirmed Claude Opus 4-6 is properly configured as primary model
- Investigated session count discrepancy (149 vs actual active sessions)
- Identified issue: cron jobs creating duplicate sessions instead of reusing them

### 3. Session Management Discovery
- Found that health check shows 149 sessions including historical cron jobs
- Actual active sessions: ~10 (main chat, groups, current cron jobs)
- 142+ sessions are historical cron job sessions that accumulated over time
- Explained that this is normal behavior but inflates the count

### 4. Operational Excellence

- All automated reports (GitHub AI agents, Xiaohongshu trends, Polymarket) running successfully
- Set up reminder for next Thursday to follow up with Sarah about quotation system requirements
- WhatsApp gateway experiencing brief disconnections but auto-recovering

### 5. Documentation & Process
- Created memory compaction summary with key insights
- Updated daily memory log with today's accomplishments
- Successfully pushed changes to GitHub repository
- Established weekly documentation process for continuous improvement

## Technical Insights
- Session count inflation due to cron job session creation pattern
- System health consistently excellent across all metrics
- Security audit recommendations logged for future attention
- Model configuration confirmed working with Claude Opus as primary

## Next Actions
- Monitor token usage to confirm Claude Opus consistency
- Address security configuration items when convenient
- Consider session cleanup or reuse configuration for cron jobs
- Continue maintaining excellent system reliability
