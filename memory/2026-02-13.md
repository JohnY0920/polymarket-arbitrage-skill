# Session: 2026-02-13
**Session Key:** agent:main:main
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Time:** 10:40-10:42 EST
**Model:** Claude Opus 4-6

## Model Configuration Issue Identified

**Problem:** System showing Kimi token usage despite Claude Opus being configured
**Root Cause:** Default model configuration has Gemini Flash as primary, with Kimi as first fallback
**Solution:** Forced session to use Claude Opus directly, but need to update default config

## Key Findings:
1. Configuration shows: Primary = Gemini Flash → Fallbacks = Kimi → Gemini Pro → Claude Opus → Sonnet
2. Session was actually using Kimi despite status showing Claude
3. Forced model override to Claude Opus successful for current session

## Action Items:
- Update default model configuration to prioritize Claude Opus
- Monitor token usage to confirm Claude is being used
- Consider making Claude the primary model instead of fallback

## Technical Details:
- Session transcript confirmed Kimi API calls: `"provider":"moonshot","model":"kimi-k2-0905-preview"`
- Model override command: `session_status with model="anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"`
- Need permanent configuration change for consistent usage

## Additional Issues Investigated:

- Cause: Translation function misfire during message composition
- Prevention: Need to verify language settings and translation triggers
